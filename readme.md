# BulkPass (bkpass)

BKPass stands for **BulkPass**, a program designed to create a bunch of complex passwords in a short amount of time using a simple algorithm to generate unique long passwords.

Upon opening the program, you will be greeted with multiple prompts, first being the drive you would like the passwords to be saved in, the second how long you want passwords to go up to, and the third being how many you want in each folder.
